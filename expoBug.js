While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server failed to start properly. The error message was vague, only indicating a general failure without specifying the cause.  I tried various troubleshooting steps, including reinstalling Expo CLI, checking my Node.js version, and ensuring all dependencies were correctly installed, but the problem persisted. The error message didn't provide any clues about the underlying cause or where to start debugging.
