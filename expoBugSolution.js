The vague error message from the Expo CLI development server was resolved by identifying a conflict in package versions.  Specifically, an older version of React Native was conflicting with a newer version of Expo. By carefully examining the `package.json` file and using `npm ls` to visualize the dependency tree, I pinpointed the conflicting package.

Solution:

1. Updated the `package.json` file to specify exact versions of all dependencies (specifically React Native and Expo). Use the `npm update` command to update the packages.
2. After cleaning the `node_modules` folder with `rm -rf node_modules` and reinstalling packages with `npm install` the problem was resolved.
